## About
This project was inspired by [Monkeytype](https://github.com/monkeytypegame/monkeytype). The alternate name is a reference to a classmate. 

Shoutout to Mugi and zhekch for inspo.

## Project Goals
- Two WPM counters, one called burst-wpm, which refreshes the words per minute after each word typed, and another (this one is just called plain WPM) that updates in real-time.
- A speedometer that updates in real time, in coordination with the user's WPM.
- An 'accelerometer' which updates according to the change in speed over time (acceleration)
- A neat, customizable GUI 

## Progress
- [x] ~Burst WPM~
- [ ] Standard WPM
- [ ] Speedometer
- [ ] Accelerometer
- [ ] Customisation menu
- [ ] Github Pages

## Learning Goals
- Get better at Python and learn more about terminal interaction through libraries like curses
- Maybe learn about classes and other aspects of OOP if I can
- Master git and version control
